# RESP.app (RDM) Flatpak files

Needed files for the packaging of [RESP.app](https://github.com/uglide/RedisDesktopManager) (formerly RedisDesktopManager) in Flatpak.

# Go check RESP on Flathub! 

<del>Glad to see that RESP is [available on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/app.resp.RESP). :tada:</del>

RESP is now [RedisInsight](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.redis.RedisInsight).

The developer forked this repository and used it as a base to package the app in Flatpak. Super glad that I could help in the process.

# Base for other projects

I'm leaving this repository open and public, so other apps with the same structure can use it as a starting point
